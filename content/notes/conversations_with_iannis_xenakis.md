Definitely inspiring. Xenakis is certainly a mentor for me in the field of music, and even in my life. Some of the fun parts of those conversations will be posted as follows, maybe with my comment. I'm not sure if I have the ability to give one.

I'm endeavoring to read and write more in English these days, because I find it challenging to express myself in English and read in English as quickly as I can in Chinese... Need to start practicing now.

This defence mechanism remains with me today. Because of this I write completely original music. I know it sounds ridiculous, but sometimes a sentimental melody can move me to tears. However, I don't want to be moved.

*Why not*?

Because music shouldn't be listened to in this way. These feelings were planted in me because of my experiences as a child. It reminds me of my family and my time at school. Also it's not the music itself that affects me so much, but simply its subjective colouring.

In my view, the same music will evoke quite different reactions in two or three hundred years, because the terms of reference of the listener will be completely different. I am sure that Bach's
compositions had a completely different effect on his con temporaries than on today's audience. It is not that the music itself is laden with emotions. The music does not dictate that we must be happy here or sad there. The reaction is defined by the society in which we grow up. European music says something completely different to a Chinese audience than to a European one, and we hear Chinese music with totally different ears from the Chinese themselves. But that's obvious.

I reacted against music because I felt I was too sensitive. Music could even bring me to tears. It was silly. But it still happens today. I have realized that emotions can envelop me in connec tion with other things as well - such as architecture, sculpture or poetry. This became clear when I was fifteen or sixteen, in other words during adolescence, when one undergoes deep, dramatic changes. It was then that I decided to concentrate seriously on music - first of all by learning to play an instrument.

*You were a sensitive child and had had a lonely and unhappy life - it was
natural that you should have taken refuge in an imaginary world where
you felt at home. You must have felt nostalgic for the old Greece, the age
of Pericles.*

Yes. I felt I was born too late - **I had missed two millennia**. I
didn't know what there was for me to do in the twentieth century. But of course there was music and there were the natural
sciences. They were the link between ancient times and the
present, because both had been an organic part of ancient
thinking.

I discovered Plato and read almost all the dialogues - the Republic, the Banquet and the shorter ones too. I didn't read much
Aristotle but a great deal of Thucydides and Xenophon. And I
devoured the poets, mainly Sappho, whom I particularly liked for
the musical quality, the imagery and language of her poems. I
read them in the original Aeolian dialect.

I also studied historical writings on ancient Greece and visited
the sites of great historical events. I remember making several
visits to a mound in Marathon which has a relief at its foot that
was made by Aristocles in the fifth century b c . The original is in
the Archaeological Museum of Athens. It shows a soldier, stand
ing, in archaic style. There's a quotation from Aeschylus' The
Persians carved into the stone. It goes something like this: 'The
Athenians have destroyed the power of gold-bearing Medes.' I
made pilgrimages there and projected myself into that age...

*How about Romanesque and Gothic?*

I didn't know Romanesque architecture and I didn't like the
Gothic. Because it was Gothic. The Greeks, you know, always
thought of themselves as special, with regard to both the East and
the West. Even today we say we're going to Europe when we
leave the country.

*And how about Honegger?*

Honegger? That was interesting, I must tell you about that. He
taught composition at a course run by the Ecole Normale. There
was no entrance examination and you had to pay a fee for the
lessons. His method consisted of the pupils playing their compositions for him to comment on, and then they would discuss
them in front of the class.

After a while I volunteered a piano piece I'd written. He asked
me to play it, and when I had finished he said: But there are
parallel octaves here! Yes, I know, I replied, but I like them. He
became more and more angry and finally said: This is no music!
Perhaps the first few bars are - but no, even they are not music! I
said nothing but stopped attending his classes.

...

*We then came upon the piano piece that had aroused Honegger's
wrath. I asked Xenakis to play it on the upright piano in his studio.
Thefirst few bars, which Honegger reluctantly accepted as music,
added up to a solemn melody accompanied by consonant chords which
all of a sudden, at a spot marked by an asterisk indicating the
beginning of the section rejected by Honegger, seemed to lose direction,
consonance giving way to dissonance. Xenakis had also written the
first half of Honegger's remark over thefirst bars, omitting the second
half (about how even thefirst few bars were not music) because he was
ashamed of it. There was another quotation as well: 'He regarded this
passage as atrocious because of the parallel octaves and the retard once
heard before.' On reading this comment Xenakis played the passage
over two or three times, to recapitulate what Honegger may have
meant.*
